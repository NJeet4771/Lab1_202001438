## Functional Requirements:
System should have following functional requirements:
1. Anyone who wishes to utilise the library resources must sign up using a username and password on the library information system.
2. Any member who successfully enrolled should be able to access the LIS using the user ID and password they created.
3. Any LIS user, whether a member or not, should be able to search for a book on LIS by author, book title, or publisher.
4. Any member of LIS should be able to issue the book given that the book is currently available in the library and is not being issued by any other member.
5. A book can be issued for 15 days. That is, a book once issued should be returned within the next 15 days by the corresponding member of LIS. After the member returns the book, his/her account should be updated to confirm the same.
6. If a member finds that he needs the issued book for more than 15 days, then after this time period, the system should be able to extend the borrowing period of the book for the user for another 15 days, only if the book is not requested by some other user.

## Non-Functional Requirements:
System should have following Non-functional requirements:
1. The system should be able to show search results 24x7. However, book issuing, returning extension of validity period should be available during the library hours only.
2. This system should be accessible only within the institute LAN.
3. The system should be able to handle around a hundred users simultaneously.
4. The system should be developed using HTML 5.

# Q-2
## Features
- The software enables users to monitor their hearing health over time and can be connected to decision-support tools that motivate users to take action in the face of hearing loss.
- The approach is used considered on the distension vibration that notifies the user of incoming messages or calls in their mobile.
- Knowing that sign language is used as a communication tool for the deaf, technology should help those who are unable to understand sign language by translating it into a form that can be easily understood. If a suitable medium of communication, such as a mobile phone, is available, this will make it easier for them to interact with others. This will assist in removing obstacles encountered when hearing-impaired people communicate with hearing people.
- Audio is considered to be a less significance aspect of user since they are likely to hear, but using audio could be added advantage when the application is focused for communication between the hearing-impaired and normal people.
- Hearing-impaired might needs an application that could attract them and one of the criteria is animation. Animation is an important aspect to be considered for hearing-impaired application (Adamo-Villani, 2007; Zhou et al., 2012). It will help the mind to relate graphic and it could enable the curiosity among these slow learners to utilize the application. While usage of text (captioning) on the other hand is important for creating a relationship between the animation and video would enable the learner to enjoy the learning process and make them engaged towards the application.
- Four main requirements that generally used in mobile development which are: 1) Consistent 2) Offline and online operations 3) Seamless connectivity 4) Multi-platform supports 5) Optimized power use and performance.

## Scope
- In essence, this smartphone software helps hearing-impaired people in a variety of ways, including learning, communication, teaching, religion, and games.
- Since the hearing-impaired cannot hear the sound coming from their phones, the vibration feature in mobile apps could readily inform them. Other applications for the vibration mode included lesser, higher, and pattern mode. This vibration mode can be altered depending on the severity of the user's hearing loss issue.

## Non-functional apects
- Accessibility
- Affordability
- Advanced sensors
- Mobile application developed must be able to ensure prospect of a user, along with the limiation in mobile technology.
